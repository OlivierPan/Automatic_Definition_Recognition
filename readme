The task is to recognize automatically the definition phrase in scientific articles, in French of course. And in the context of 
generalisation of probabilistic methods, the best performance of this task is made with a rule method, developped by Thierry Hamon.

The rule method consists of two basic elements:
1, the markers;
2, the morphosyntaxique features.

Neither is easy, especially when we take into account the number of markers and their different form; and the 
amount of features in a phrase, difficult to make an abstraction.

BUT. This is the rule methode and we have to do it.
