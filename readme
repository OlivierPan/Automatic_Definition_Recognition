The rule method consists of two basic elements:
1, the markers;
2, the morphosyntaxique features.

Neither is easy, especially when we take into account the number of markers and their different form; and the 
amount of features in a phrase, difficult to make an abstraction.

BUT. This is the rule methode and we have to do it.
